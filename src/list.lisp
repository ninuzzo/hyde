TODO: is the one above the fastest implementation?

Alternate implementations (with no symbol support):

(defun flatten (list)
  (loop for i in list if (listp i) append (flatten i) else collect i) 

(defun flatten (list)
  (cond
    ((null list) nil)
    ((atom list) (list list))
    (t (loop for elem in list appending (flatten elem)))))

(defun flatten (list)
  (if list
      (if (atom list) (list list) (mapcan #'flatten list))))

(defun flatten (list)
  (cond
    ((null list) nil)
    ((atom list) (list list))
    (t (append (flatten (car list)) (flatten (cdr list))))))

(defun flatten (orig-list)
  (if (eql orig-list nil)
      nil
      (let ((elem (car orig-list)) (resto-list (cdr orig-list)))
        (if (listp elem)
            (append (flatten elem) (flatten resto-list))
            (append (cons elem nil) (flatten resto-list)))))))
